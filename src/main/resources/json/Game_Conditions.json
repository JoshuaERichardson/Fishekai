Desperation takes hold as you search in vain for sustenance, but the land offers no respite. Your strength wanes, limbs heavy with exhaustion. The final moments blur, your vision dimming, as you succumb to the cold embrace of starvation. The island mourns your valiant efforts, its secrets forever untouched by your hunger-stricken hands.

Your throat grows parched, your lips cracked and dry. The hallucinations begin, distorting the reality around you. Shadows dance in the shimmering heat, mocking your feeble existence. As your body weakens further, your steps falter until they cease altogether. The island, witness to your agonizing demise, mourns the loss of another soul claimed by its relentless grip. May your indomitable spirit be remembered, a testament to the unforgiving nature of thirst."
